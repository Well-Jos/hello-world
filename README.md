# hello-world
the 1st time is always the best
I'm super excited about learning this information.
I remember taking my first CPT class in high school, yeah I got college credit. 
The class was seriously bootlegged but I did learn and pass. 
I'm a crafting/art conissuer. You name it, I will attempt to create it.
I'm looking forward to learning the art of Web Development and Information Security.
